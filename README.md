# wscreen

Website screenshots from the CLI!

```
$ wscreen https://example.org -w 1440 -h 1024
```

## Installation

Requires node.

(I should probably publish this as a package)

1. `git clone https://github.com/alexjohnsv/wscreen.git`
2. Run `npm i`
3. Create an alias

```
alias wscreen='node /path/to/wscreen/index.js'
```
